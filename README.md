# Apple-2-Keyboard-to-Apple-1

This is a simple PCB that converts the signals from an Apple II or Apple II+ keyboard to an Apple 1. There is a version that uses DIP-to-IDC connectors and another that uses DIP-to-DIP connectors. Pay close attention to the pinout when you make your connections! connecting the cables backwards can cause damage.
